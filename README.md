# 🔍User Filter

This project is a simple and interactive user search/filter application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It dynamically fetches random user data from an external API and allows real-time filtering through a search input.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal is to provide a live user filtering experience using the **Fetch API** and DOM manipulation. As the user types into the input field, the list is instantly updated to show only the matching results.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Random user data is fetched from [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/)
- All users are displayed on the page with name, location, and picture
- Typing into the search bar filters the list in real time

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript (Fetch API)**
